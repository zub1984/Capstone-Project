    <!-- logo_highlight can't use the same color as button_highlight because the button's ripples
    automatically add a little bit transparency. The logo has no ripples and so
    we can't use ?attr/colorControlHighlight for the logo's color. Even though it's
    clickable, it doesn't have any pressed state since it's suppose to disappear
    instantly. And so it will not add any transparency to the color: ?attr/colorControlHighlight.
    The default for ?attr/colorControlHighlight might change with next Android versions, so we
    make a copy color of ?attr/colorControlHighlight as button_highlight and then find a lighter
    shade of that color as logo_highlight maintaining consistency for future Android versions-->
